# PHYS523
Equine RTK Project

Includes all Code going into Project for Physics 523.

-Basestation code

-RTCM Client code

Both were adapted from Sparkfun GNSS and RadioLib Library Example Codes and developed for the LoRa Things eXploraBLe Plus

Things to Test:

1. Maximum Connection distance for the current LoRa antennae - previous test ~ 0.2mi
2. Will putting the base station on the roof improve horizontal accuracy to ~ 1cm as in Sparkfun specs
3. Usefulness of IMU - Do after GNSS System for sure works
4. Adjust the code to provide data in a way that may contain actual insight into the health of the horse
